    <h2>About the Museum</h2>
    The World Museum has approximately 25 million artifacts and continues to collect hundreds of thousands annually. For cultural and research purposes, the museum has recently tasked PWC to digitise its collection. This website serves as the public access to the database of already-digitised artifacts.

    <h2>Digitisation Efforts</h2>
    As of current, the large and heavy dry objects, and the small dry objects are being digitised through 3D scanning, photography, and reflectance transformation imaging (RTI). These produce accurate digital depictions of the arifacts, that are suitable reference material for scientists and preserves and makes cultural artifacts more readibly accessible and sustainable. 

    To learn more about the digitisation techniques and processes, please read below.

    <h3>3D Scanning</h3>
    Woof woof, something something something about 3D Scanning.

    <h3>Reflectance Transformation Imaging</h3>
